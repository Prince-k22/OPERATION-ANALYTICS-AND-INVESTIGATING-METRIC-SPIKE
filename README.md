# OPERATION-ANALYTICS-AND-INVESTIGATING-METRIC-SPIKE
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this Operation Analytics project, I, as a Data Analyst Lead at a company like Microsoft, will conduct a thorough analysis of the company's end-to-end operations. By collaborating closely with teams such as operations, support, and marketing, I will leverage their collected data to identify areas for improvement and provide valuable insights.
This analysis is crucial for predicting the company's overall growth or decline, leading to better automation, improved collaboration among cross-functional teams, and more efficient workflows.
A key component of operation analytics is investigating metric spikes. As a Data Analyst, I will diligently examine fluctuations in daily engagement, sales performance, and other important metrics, answering questions that arise on a daily basis.
In my role, I will work with diverse data sets and tables to extract insights and provide clear answers to inquiries from different departments. Utilizing my SQL skills and expertise, I will contribute to evidence-based decision-making and foster a deeper understanding of operational performance, ultimately contributing to the company's success.

- Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis:
In this case, I will analyze the job data related trends on a job data table which consists of columns like job IDs, actor IDs, event, language, time spent, organization along with dates. I will be analyzing this data to find answers to questions related to Number of jobs reviewed, Throughput, Percentage share of each language and Duplicate rows.
